The land and the building was first on the market with Country Real Estate: Post Properties and Harrell Post. After 2 years, Ken switched to NEO Reality with David Davis. David Davis had it for about 1.5 years before Ken switched back to Harrell Post. Harrell had it another 2 years, and Ken switched back to David Davis who has it listed on the market still today. 
The 30,000 square feet metal building as well as the 6.4 acre land, right next to the Turnpike Gate was orignally listed 2.8 million dollars. Ken then dropped the price to 2 million. Then 1.8 million. It is now listed at 1.5 million. 
A freight company set out to buy the store and it's land, but the partners would not follow through. There were 2 other places interested in the land and the building, but unfortunately none were able to follow through.
