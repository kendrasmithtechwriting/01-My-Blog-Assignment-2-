# History Behind the Scenes 
In an effort to provide the community with history dating back to the 1970’s on one of the cities most “prized” stores, I prepared a story not many know. Revealing information some family, past employees, and the community did not know. Here is the story of Ken’s Farm and Home.

Ken's Farm and Home once located in Miami, Oklahoma was locally owned and operated by Ken and Marilyn Hunsperger for 34 years. It served as a staple for the local farming community. The store sold a variety of items ranging from clothing, housewares, hardware, Stihl products and other lawn service items, and farming equipment.

As a granddaughter of Ken and Marilyn, I have encountered and acquired this historical information first hand. I hope this information is beneficial to you to show the behind the scenes look at this important community business. I have witnessed first hand the happiness, as well as the sorrow the store brought to the town and citizens of Miami, Oklahoma. Thank you all for the love and support you have shown my family since 1976.

## In the beginning 
Ken and Marilyn Hunsperger closed their gas station, "Ken's MFA" in Mansfield, Missouri in the beginning of 1976 before moving to Miami, Oklahoma. Ken's tire supplier, Raye Moore, introduced Ken to Ray Swisher and Loui Feldman in 1976 who, after meeting, decided to open a farm store and began searching for locations. The men reviewed several locations including West Plains, Missouri and Paragould, Arkansas. Back in the 1970s, in order to build a new farm store, other farm stores that were in close proximity had to approve the new store. The men tried to build in Monett, Mo but Springfield, Mo said no. They tried to build in Neosho, Mo but Carthage, Mo said no. So they crossed state lines into Oklahoma. Miami was right on the border between Kansas and Missouri and the store in Stillwater, Oklahoma gave the go ahead. So after reviewing the demographics of several areas, the men decided on Miami, Oklahoma. Ken closed his gas station in 1976 and stayed during the week in the "Thunderbird" motel leaving his wife, Marilyn, and two teenage daughters, Kathleen and Novaleen, in Mansfield. Ken traveled back to Mansfield every weekend to be with his family while spending the week constructing the building for his future farm store.  
The men contracted with Collins Construction to build the 20,000 square feet metal building. The building was located on 2220 E Steve Owens Boulevard on a 6.4 acre piece of land right next to the Turnpike Gate. The land the store was built on was originally a wheat field outside of city limits. After 7 months of construction, the battle began. Ken and partners began the search of electricians to wire the store. After searching, every company the men asked to wire the building said no due to threats from the electric company in town. The company, who Ken and Marilyn want to remain anonymous, threatened other electricians by saying "they were going to take away their license" if they wired the building. The family of Ken and Marilyn believe this to be because the company did not want the farm and home store in town due to competitive fear.  
Ken filed a lawsuit against the city in 1976. After 3 battles in court, the city finally decided that if the business got an electrical engineer, they would inspect and approve the wiring. That is when the business hired electrical engineer Cooley from Stillwater, Oklahoma. After Cooley had begun installing the wiring, the city refused to come inspect the wiring being done. Ken and his partners gave Cooley the go ahead to finish the job and said they would fight in court later.  
Shortly after the business opened in August of 1977, the City of Miami came and removed the temporary construction pole the store had been generating electricity from because they did not do the inspection. Local farmers, Leo Glenn, Ray Schumake, and several others got together and brought Ken a generator to help provide electricity. The men said they would do whatever it took to help keep Ken's Farm and Home in business and to keep the business in town. When the city pulled the electric pole during business hours, customers were left stranded in the dark. Employees gathered flashlights to help guide customers throughout the store and to help cashiers see to write paper tickets. The business ran off a generator for 3 months. Every morning, Ken would go start up the old 1960 John Deere tractor and the generator to help keep his new business afloat. No matter what Ken, his business partners, or his family faced, they were going to fight. During this battle, REC (Rural Electric Company) offered to extend their power across the road from the Turnpike to give the store power if the city refused again to give them electricity. The City of Miami did not approve of this plan and went forward in inspecting the wiring the men had Cooley do.  The city engineer came in and said "he had to find at least one thing wrong" with the wiring. After the city inspector was in the building for 6 hours, only with himself and Cooley, he talked to Cooley about any and everything he used. The one thing wrong was Cooley used 20 amp fuses in the breaker box and 15 amp fuses in the lights. There were 109 lights in the building. The city engineer spent the 6 hours searching the building top to bottom, while doing so, he revealed that he only had 2 more years left with the city before he could retire. He said if he did not find at least one thing wrong, the city would find an excuse to fire him, and he would lose his retirement.  After finding his one thing, he told Ken to fix the problem. So Ken did. After Ken fixed the problem, the city finally gave the business electricity.

## During operation 
Once the business opened, sales soon began to pick up. The business soon started booming and ran out of room, so they added an additional 10,000 square feet to the back of the building for a storage room.

After 15 years of the business being open, the city limits stretched out just to the outskirts of the land behind Ken's Farm and Home. Therefore giving the city revenue due to city taxes forced upon the business. Before the city limits were stretched, customers only had to pay state tax.

Ken's Farm and Home averaged around 18 employees. Ken and Marilyn could not recall an approximate total number of employees in their 33 years, but they did say "too many". They did have a couple long-term employees: Barbara and Cloyce Newkirk, Leo Glenn, Patsy Gilmore, Eileen Brisbois, Mary Dady, Terry Schrader, Opal Smith, Joe Bruce and numerous others. 

Ken's Farm and Home held an annual 2 hour sale where everything in the store was a select percentage off. During those sales, employees worked tirelessly and the family was called in for all hands on deck. The store would quickly be filled with chaotic shoppers. 

The store featured a number of products and name brands. Mechanics were Stihl certified to sale Stihl chainsaws, blowers, and weedeaters. They also worked on a number of products, including lawn mowers. The store also sold horseshoes, leather paddles, whips, show sticks, generators, various Ace brand hardware, and DeWalt tools. Marilyn also had her "side" of the store where they sold Double H, Muck, Justin, Durango, Ariat, Georgia, and Minnetonka Moccasins boots/shoes. They also had various clothing brands like Wrangler, Lee, Dickies, Karen Hart, Carhartt, and Key Overalls. Marilyn also loved her housewares that she filled with Lodge Iron Skillets, Willow Tree Angel figurines, an assortment of Kerr canning supplies. The kids favorite, the toy aisle, was also favored by adult collectors. Including Schleich, Bryer Horses, Lincoln Logs, Radio Flyer, Tinker Toys, Ertl toys, and kids ride on push tractors. They also sold grass feed, railroad ties, fence post, cattle panels, feeders, vaccines, dog houses, water tanks, hot water heaters, mixed paint, made keys, and much much more. 

If you could not find what you were looking for, if you would mention it to Ken, he would take you upstairs and search catalogs for hours until you found just the right product at the right price. Then he would order it for you, at your convenience. Ken, having grown up on his dads farm himself and milking cows every morning, knew the struggle of farming and the necessity of certain products within time frames. He did his best to cater his farming community at their best convenience. 
Citizens of Miami always claimed "you have everything in here! Stuff we would never even imagine!". Ken's Farm and Home was a one stop shop. No longer did the community need to stop by various locations in order to get all the parts and pieces they needed, Ken's had it all (which was great for families and farmers with limited time).  

While there were similar stores in a 30 mile radius, there was not another "one stop shop" like Ken's. This was especially helpful for the community. 
The business donated supplies, donated money towards ads, and various other components to help out the school and its organizations. Ken's Farm and Home was also an active bidder in the Ottawa County Fair Premium Sale. 
Ken's Farm and Home also helped with rodeo wear, supplies, and ads for the annual Rodeo Miami. 

## Closing the Doors 
On November 17th of 2008, Ken had his first open heart surgery to replace a leaking mitral valve that was causing a series of problems. Ken's cardiac surgeon, Dr. Phillips from Freeman Hosptial in Joplin, Mo. said he almost lost Ken on the operating table while performing the leaking valve. After the surgery, it took Ken months to regain strength from the surgery. Despite Dr. Phillip's best efforts, the leaking valve was only the beginning of Ken's heart journey. In February 2010, Ken was admitted into Barnes Jewish Hospital in Saint Louis, Mo where Dr. Gregory Ewald placed a combination Pacemaker Difibulator. During the couple years battling Ken's cardiac problems, the family decided, despite best efforts, it was in the best interest to close the family business. This was a very hard decision for the family, for they hated to see such hard work come to a close. But they feared that something were to happen to Ken and they would not know all the ins and outs that Ken did and the business would be too much for the small family to take on. So in February of 2011, after 34 years of business, the doors of Ken's Farm and Home would be opening and closing one last time. The business ran sales to try and rid much of the inventory so the auction would be less chaotic. After running the sale for approximately 2 weeks, the business had Clapp Auction auction off the remaining of the inventory. Boxes were packed and sold as units. The auction was devasting for the family to watch. Items in the auction were being sold for little to nothing, and they watched all their hard work, time, effort, and business finance crumble to the ground. Though it was hard, it was great for the community to receive quality products at such great prices.  
After the auction, Ken put his building and land up for sale.
Ken's health continued to improve gradually, but at the age of 74, his physical health was reaching a peak. Ken loved his business and wore his Ken's Farm and Home hat everywhere he went. Customers would stop by when they would see Ken and his family dining out and ask "so when are you opening the store back up? I really miss it" and comment things like "you never know what you have until its gone. We really need a store like yours around here. You just can't find those products you had close by. You always had everything!". Ken and his family would chuckle and reminisce on all the memories they had in the store. Ken and his family wished too that the store never had to close, but they knew it was in their best interest. Each time Ken and his wife Marilyn heard comments, they would merely nod their head and say "yeah I wish" and politely say "thank you".  

Closing the doors not only had an impact on the family, but it had an impact on the local community. Farmers soon realized how crucial it was to them that Ken's Farm and Home was so close. Once the business closed and they needed a part quickly, they would forget Ken's was closed and then spend the next several hours parading around town searching for the part. Often times, no place in town would have the supplies they needed and they would have to plan a trip to visit another town up to 2 hours away (sometimes more) the next day and have to postpone their work. It was definitely a struggled faced by the farmers, especially in the first several months. Families also had to travel to find winter wear, rodeo wear, gifts, etc because no where in town had what they needed or were looking for. The closest Western wear store that had alot of variety at that time was an hour and a half away. This took time out of the lives of our regular customers lives and definitely took time to get used to. The community did not realize how much Ken's offered to them at such a convenience until after the business had closed. 

## Currently 
The land and the building was first on the market with Country Real Estate: Post Properties. Since then, it has switched multiple agents and their respective companies.  Today, NEO Reality and agent Lee Walker has it listed on the market.

A freight company set out to buy the store and it's land, but the partners would not follow through. There were 2 other places interested in the land and the building, but unfortunately none were able to follow through.

The store is currently being rented for shelving storage by a local business. 

You can see the land and the building Ken's Farm and Home once sat upon everytime you visit the East side of town. Anyone passing through Northeast Oklahoma can see the building as they drive on the Turnpike. Each time a citizen pays toll at Turnpike Gate Exit 313, they can reminisce all the time and memories they once spent in that building and how much Ken's Farm and Home had to offer. May they, may you, never forget the impact it had on the county. May we never forget to cherish the things we have because you may never know what you have until it is gone. 

The 30,000 square feet building and 6.4 acre land are listed on the following websites:

### About Me
Hello, my name is Kendra Smith and I am from Miami Oklahoma. I am the daughter of Novaleen (Hunsperger) Smith and the granddaughter of Ken and Marilyn Hunsperger. I grew up in their farm store, Ken's Farm and Home, until I was 13. Most of you will probably remember me by the little twins that used to run around the store. I loved every moment of growing up in the store, and it taught me so much that I have carried on to my adult life today. I learned that hard work pays off, you should persevere through all trials in life, and to never give up. Being raised in the family business gave me a strong work ethic that has led to many of my successes today.

My favorite memory of the store would be when the ice storm of December 2007 came. My family and I lost electricity at our houses, so we packed up some clothes, blankets, and some mattresses and headed for the store. We all piled in upstairs to sleep a couple of hours before we had customers banging on the glass doors at the front of the stores at 6am begging us to open so they could get supplies. My mom wrote down everyones purchases on paper, my grandma helped customers get a variety of winter wear and cooking supplies, my twin sister, Caitlin, and I were busy away showing everyone all the lanterns, wicks, and oil was that we had to offer, all whilst my brother, Kaleb, and my grandpa Ken showed people around with flashlights to purchase generators, ice melt, shovels, and chainsaws. Within about an hour and a half, my sister and I had sold out of every lantern we had in stock.

We took pride in our grandpas store and were constantly into something trying to do our part. We loved to help in the boots and run to the back store room to get boots off the towering shelves to help our farming buddies. We also had a fun time when were really small, probably 6 and younger, going around firing employees we felt were slacking off. If we saw them sitting down or leaning and just talking, Caitlin and I would both say "you're fired". Our favorite employees to fire, Leo Glenn and Cloyce Newkirk, were probably fired a hundred times. Luckily both men watched us grow up and were family friends so they did not scare off. 

But most of all, I cherish the memories I made it the store and the lessons I learned throughout my short time there. My family and my faith are the most important aspects of my life, and I am so thankful and blessed to have been able to learn these values while growing up right next to them. Even when times were tough, they were there teaching me how to be successful and loyal through their business. 

Now, 21 years old and soon to be graduated with a Bachelors degree in Nutrition and Dietetics and an Associates degree in Christian Ministry from College of the Ozarks, I have been successful in my time at "Hard Work U" because of the things I learned from my family first hand throughout my years at Ken's Farm and Home.

I want to personally thank the community for rising to the occasion and supporting my family not only in the 35 years of business, but in the 41 years they have lived here.
